                I just feel like something good is about to happen,
                I just feel like something good is on it’s way,
                He has promised that He’d open all of Heaven,
                And, brother, it could happen any day.

            When God’s people humble themselves and call on Jesus,
            And they look to <em>Heaven</em> expecting as they pray,
            I just <strong>feels like something good is about to happen,</strong> 
            And, brother, this could be that very day.
